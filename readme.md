# get stuff done: blocking websites and programs so you can, well, get stuff done

## What is this?

This is a project that I wrote for the 2024 UQ Computing Society hackathon. I wrote this because I couldn't get work done as I kept on getting distracted by websites such as Discord, Reddit, GBATemp, and other social media/forum/messaging sites. Although it didn't win anything, I'm still proud of it as it is my first large project in Rust and I plan to update it more :)

This will automate changes to crontabs and /etc/hosts so that it will unlock after you get some work done on a coding file, or after a certain amount of time. To use it, you need Linux, and a working cron daemon.

## How do I use it?

First, make this using cargo. I'm very very new to cargo, `cargo build -r` *should* do what you need. You also need to set up a config file (detailed below) before using the app.
To start a session, run `./gsd start` (or replace `./gsd` with whatever the name of the binary is), and then add flags for whether you want it to track time or a file. **This no longer needs to be run under sudo, but will explain it is calling sudo and ask for a password** as it writes to /etc/hosts, updates the root crontab and restarts your network service.

## How do I set it up?

Ideally, I want to make it so that you can set up entirely though commands: using `./gsd network` to specify a command to be run (under sudo) to restart the network and apply changes to /etc/hosts, and use `./gsd add -w` and `./gsd add -p` to block websites and programs, respectively. However, this relies on having a `config.toml` file which I haven't gotten around to making a generator for. For this, an example of what this file should look like is provided below:

```toml
[system]
# command to restart network service to refresh /etc/hosts. doesn't include sudo.
network_command = 'systemctl restart dhcpcd'

[blocklist]
# make sure to include www. if it is part of the URL. check on a per-website basis: comapre
# www.reddit.com and discord.com
websites = [
  'discord.com',
  'www.reddit.com',
  'gbatemp.net',
  'www.facebook.com',
  'www.tumblr.com',
  'tech.lgbt',
]
# programs should be what the process name is called. e.g. 'Discord' will kill discord
# proccesses but 'discord' won't
programs = [
  'Discord',
  'steam',
]
```

## What are the limitations of this?

- You need Linux. Sorry, fellow procrastinators who use Windows.
- If you have some very unorthadox distrobution, it may not work. Quite a few assumtions are made - in an ideal world I'll only assume that you have crontabs, a /tmp folder, home directory, and some basic shell commands (i.e. sudo, rm, cp, crontab) however it **currently assumes that the command you need to run for restarting the network service is under /usr/bin**.
- You can only track plaintext files. If you want 100 words written on some essay, then the track may not work for you.
- On a similar note, this only works for lines, not words at the current moment. This may be changed as I have to write LaTeX files quite often...
- It's easy to fudge. You can just write meaningless comments to increase line count to unlock websites, and there's nothing stopping you from reverting changes to crontabs and /etc/hosts. If you want this, there's a Perl program out there for you called Lockout: <https://thomer.com/lockout/> which will lock you out of root; this is however a big risk to take. get stuff done is safer!

## What are some improvements that could be made here?
- It's way too easy to break out of. There is nothing stopping you from going and editing crontabs and /etc/hosts yourself - I just hope that it's too much effort for you absentmindedly browsing the web. That being said, I can add anti-editing measures for particularly determined procrastinators.
- If you don't have a config file, the program won't work. It's not too hard to make, but it'd be nicer if it automatically made a config file if you don't have one.
- I could make it possible to track more than just lines in a plaintext file - reading words from a WYSISYG document format and reading words from a plaintext file are both things that would be useful if implemented.
- This doesn't have a GUI. It's not neccesary, but it'd be cool.
- I could add a log of when it's used, so you can track how much time you've spent working on a project.
- I could make it run on Windows.
That being said, all of these are only going to get implemented if this gets popular or I get the whim to :)

## Why did you decide to write this in Rust?

"hey Avery you should try writing something in Rust sometime it's such a cool language"
